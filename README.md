# GPA Calculator and Planner
by Teddy Clark

This java program provides an easy way to track your GPA. You can add previously taken courses and anticipated courses, and the program will tell you what grade you need in the anticipated courses based on a target GPA. You can also enter a whole semester by entering how ever many credits you took that semester and the average out of 4.0.
